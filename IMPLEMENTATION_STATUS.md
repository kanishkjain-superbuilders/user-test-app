## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current
- None (foundation is stable)

### Future Considerations
1. **WebRTC Scaling**: Mesh topology limited to 5 viewers. Future SFU integration needed.
2. **Mobile Safari**: No screen capture support. Desktop-only for V1.
3. **Server-side Processing**: Edge Functions may need WASM ffmpeg for thumbnails/concatenation.
4. **Cross-origin Redirects**: If target app is different origin, recording window capture required.
